# leetcode
This repository contains my daily solutions for the Problem of the Day (POTD) from LeetCode. Each solution includes a brief problem explanation, a detailed approach, and an optimized code implementation. The focus is on solving real-world coding challenges to enhance skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) while maintaining efficient time and space complexity.

By consistently solving these problems, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills and help others by providing clear, well-structured solutions.
